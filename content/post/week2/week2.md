- What have been the goals for the past two weeks and what did I achieve?
- What (parts of the workflow/research/development) was working well and why?
- What (parts of the workflow/research/development) was not working well and why?
- What would I do differently if I would be faced with the same situation or goals?
- What did I learn this week and/or what am I proud of or satisfied with?


Alright. I'm writing this on the friday of the second week of semester. Last time I wrote this I didn't know there were these prompts. This time I will try to keep these in mind while I write. 

This week we had our first two labs, and started on the lectures. We had some interesting discussions in the lecture on thursday about what vr/ar is. My definition for virtual reality is: A computer generated world in which a person can become fully immersed.

In regards to the key points from the previous post. I still haven't set a specific time to study for this paper. I think monday afternoons and tuesday morning will work well. 

How can I integrate labs with my project. Currently the labs are on the topic of game development. The lab on friday was a lot of fun actually. I would like to create a game for my project but i'm wary of it having too large of a scope. I prefer my project to be something that is tailored specifically to VR or AR with some form of interaction, rather than a 3D scene that could be viewed through a normal screen.

If we take for example the simulated ecosystem idea. It would be cool just as a 3D scene but it would ideally have some interaction that is only possible in VR. You could maybe view the scene from above and "reach in" to touch stuff using hand tracking.


## Key points
- I didn't find as much to write about as last time.
- need to think about prompts when writing
- dedicated study time on tuesday morning


## To think about
- What type of game are suitable for VR interactions/how can I use VR in a game in a novel way
