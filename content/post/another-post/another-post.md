Ok. This will be the first real entry in this blog. I'm just going to write down what I'm thinking. Hmm, I wonder If I should write the blog from the perspective of someone developing a VR experience as if I wasn't doing this as part of a course. Or if I should explicitly mention that this is part of a course and go into detail about other aspects of the course. I will ask Holger but for now I think it might be better to write it plainly as it is - part of a course. 

So what is the course then? INFO351: Special Topic - Augmented and Virtual Reality. Basically the coolest course. The bulk of the course is a semester long project where we develop an experience for Virtual or Augmented Reality. I would like to make a game, however that might be more difficult than other things (I don't know what those might be yet). We also have to write weekly blog posts (like this one). These are mostly about the project, but I suppose I can write whatever I want in here. Lastly, each student will give a lecture on a topic they choose. In each lecture the student presents a number of possible exam questions which could be asked in the final (Oral) examination. Very cool. 

This paper is much different from any other paper I have taken so far at Uni. It seems the learning is a lot more self-directed which I think is a blessing and a curse. But I think I can get a lot out of it so long as I don't give priority to other papers which have more directed learning.

How can I make sure that I do that? Definitely go to all the scheduled class time. Previously at Uni I haven't scheduled study dedicated to a specific course into a timetable, but I think I might try that this semester. Generally I like to stay flexible but for such a self-directed course I might need to make an exception.

I think I could go on and on about a lot of things, so I'm going to set a soft time limit of 1 hour of writing for these blogs posts.

I think it will also be a good Idea to have a set of bullet points at the beginning or the end of each post summarising or noting important things I thought/wrote about. It's becoming clear to me that this blog will be very useful. I think it will create a time for me to work solidify my thinking about the project, reflect, and come up with new ideas, and help me realise when I have a stupid idea.

Ok. It might be worth writing a blog for my other courses too. I'll think about that later. 

It very easy for me when I'm writing like this to dismiss thoughts I have and defer them till later like I just did. But I think its necessary to stay on topic, and so yeah it probably is a good thing. I just need to remember to actually go back and think about them later. Maybe add them to a to-think-about list? Cool idea, I'll think about it later.

It's tempting for me right now to start thinking about topics for my project. Oh, I just remembered it is a group project. Ok, do I wait to find a group or do I just start thinking about it? I'll start thinking about it. But is there anything I need to talk about before that? Labs seem all good, I need to think about how I am going to integrate the topics into the project without the project just becoming a random mish-mash of techniques. Add it to the list! I need to think about what my student lecture is going to be. Not sure if the list of topics is available yet though. Might have to schedule a time for the group to meet. I don't need to think about that yet I think I'm getting ahead of myself.

I don't ~~want~~ need to think to much about the project yet. So I'll just note down some ideas. I am subscribed to the YouTube channel Sebastian Lague. It's a really cool channel he does a lot of cool little projects with Unity. He loves compute shaders, and he has a series called "Coding Adventures" where he explores a some topic. It's definitely my favourite channel and I will be taking inspiration from some of his videos.  Some of the topics are: Ant and Slime Simulations, Chess AI, Atmosphere, Procedural Moons and Planets, Portals, Clouds, Simulating an Ecosystem, Marching Cubes, Compute Shaders, Ray Tracing and more.

One of the ideas I has was to Simulate an Ecosystem that the user could explore in VR. Maybe you could somehow integrate AR, but I'm not sure how that would look yet. Another Idea was to have a portal in VST AR that you walk through into a world or game or something.

That's pretty much my ideas so far.

## Key Points
- write as it is or as if i'm not doing this as part of a course
  - ask holger (I guess he'll see this but I'll still email him or ask in person)
- self-directed learning - I need to be careful. 
  - schedule study time 
- soft time limit of 1 hour for blog writing
- project
  - inspiration Sebastian Lague
  - simulated ecosystem
  - portals

## To-Think-About list
- blog for other courses
- how to integrate lab topics with project
