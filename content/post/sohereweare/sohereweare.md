# So here we are
Welcome to this website. I don't really know what this is going to be yet. I kinda sorta think it might just be a place I use to write about things I want to think through that aren't super personal (those go in my journal). I guess I want a place that isn't my journal to write about specific things. These things could be but aren't necessarily related to computer science (which is my major btw).

Yup that's about it. Something I've been thinking about rather frequently and something which has come up in conversation a bit is: "what does it mean to be cool". And I haven't really solidified my thoughts or come to a proper conclusion about what the answer to that might be. And I don't expect this process to fully answer that question. Maybe I'll never know. But I think I should at least try, and see what happens.

This might also improve how I write. That'd be a nice bonus.
