This one is a bit late - I'm writing it on Wednesday of week 5. I have been very busy doing the 343 AI assignment. It was actually a super fun assignment. If you're interested we had to design an AI agent to play the game of Mastermind. I spent way to long writing the code and not enough time writing the report, so I think the report wasn't as good as it could have been.

In terms of HCI, the labs last week were very cool. I was away on Thursday and Friday so I missed the lab. But I managed to listen in to the lecture while I was snowboarding haha. It actually worked pretty good, and I was able to catch up on the missed lab today. 

We created the environment panorama and viewed the 360 video in the Oculus HMD. VR tech has definitely come a long way since the last time I used it. 

We started thinking about the Projects. Andrew's temple run idea seems cool and I wouldn't mind working on that with him as a team. The space simulation idea is also cool but I think it will be quite difficult to capture the feeling of weightlessness. I wonder if it has been done before? I also think my original simulated ecosystem idea could work pretty well. I had some more ideas to add to it. Instead of being first person within the environment, you could view from a bird's eye perspective. This would be more of a "playing god" simulator where you can create species with different genes and see how they do in the environment. There's a lot more to think about here. I'll write more on Friday.

I'm getting a little behind on lectures, so I need to get on top of that. 

Otherwise I think that is all for now
