Week 3. What is there to say. We still haven't started the project. I assume that Holger will make it quite clear when we should be starting work on the project. I suppose I can just start working on it whenever I like. 

In the lab today Holger mentioned that we don't need to use the techniques we learn in the labs for our projects. This is good, for some reason I thought that maybe we should be using them in the project. It would be ideal to use them I guess but it's good to know I have plenty of room to make what I want. 

In the lab today (lab 5 I think) we created a 360Â° view of the inside of the business school using just our phone cameras, and used it to create a skybox for a unity scene. It's crazy to me how well the image compositing worked. It is a lot better than what we did in cosc 342. Next week we are going to try to place an image in the scene with the skybox and make it look somewhat realistic. An issues I'm having at the moment with it is that the ground plane at y=0 in the Unity scene is in the "middle" of the skybox. I need to figure out a way to alter it so the ground of the skybox matches the ground of the scene. I don't know how that will work because from what I understand the "bottom" of the skybox is infinitely far away. I'll figure that out in the lab next week.

The lab on Wednesday was the second game design lab. I found it really interesting. During high school I played a reasonable amount of video games but not a ton. Since the start of second year I mostly stopped completely playing video games just because I'm so busy and I would rather spend my free time outside doing something else. That said, it is still nice sometimes to spend an evening playing video games. I found what Daniel said about stupid ideas bordering good ones very interesting. I guess the story or premise of a game doesn't matter at all really if you develop it in an interesting way.  For example the idea our group developed  about a bell sounded super dumb in the beginning. But near the end of the second lab, we had transformed it into an interesting story which I honestly think might make a half-decent game. It would be fun to develop but I think it would take too long and I would also need to find a way to integrate an aspect of XR.

The cameras 101 given today by Holger was also very useful. I bought a camera at the beginning of last year and I kind of knew how most of the parameters worked but I've never had them fully explained to me. On Wednesday night actually I took some photo's at a gig for my flatmate's band No Danger. I'm getting a little off topic here but I figured out how to use the manual mode on my camera finally and the photos turned out really good. I was confused though on my camera about why I could only set the ISO, aperture, shutter speed manually but not the exposure. In the lab today I realised that it's because these three parameters together define the exposure. I think that's right but I'm not sure. I might put one of the photos from the at the bottom of this post.

What else? I scheduled meetings with Tobias on Tuesday mornings so I will have to move my study time to come after that. I'll need to watch the lectures for next week at some point.

From last week: What type of game is suitable for XR interactions? I would assume if I am going to make a game it would ~~better~~ easier to use a VR HMD rather than an AR HMD. I the type of headset will depend of the style of game (or vice versa). This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFzUljfcLDI) showcases three XR games. It is from 6 years ago but the games still look quite good. They are all using VST with the Microsoft HoloLens. It looks like the first two games fully reconstruct your environment in 3D, and use the reconstruction as the basis of the game. The first one is a mystery game, the second an platformer game. The platformer game used the 3D reconstruction as the platforms in the game. The user controls the character by looking around the scene - the character moves to wherever the user is looking. This didn't work very well because it strained the users neck too much. 

I've reached my time limit

## Key Points

- Change study time
- "Stupid" ideas border good ones
- Exposure is a combination of the other three camera parameters - not separate

## To Think about

- What mechanics are used in VR games?
- How to match the ground of the scene with the ground of the skybox?
