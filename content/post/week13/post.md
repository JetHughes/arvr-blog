The project is done! I think it's actually pretty good, and I'm happy with what Andrew and I achieved. The game is actually fun for a little while I think. The game is not beautiful but the functionality is there and people seemed to enjoy the little demo on Wednesday. Myself and some of my friends do get simulator sickness a little bit from our game which isn't great but I don't think there's much more we can do about it.

I think we could have changed the process of working on our game a bit. We tended to have an issue or something we wanted to add in, then we would figure a way to do it. And once we found one way to do it it was done and that was that. However, it would be been beneficial to come up with a few different ideas, and iterate on them to find the best way of doing it. We did it a little with the heart indicator where we initially had it fixed at a position on the users view, and then switched later to have it stuck to a controller. But I still there there is a better way to do it that we haven't found. Something where you don't have to look away from the blocks coming at you, something where you are always aware of the state without needing to check.

I think Andrew and I worked well together. In the beginning we would talk at the beginning of the labs about what each of us should do and then worked separately. We set a up a git repo so we could both work on the same scene and continuously integrate each others work which is something I think the other groups had issues with. Then later near the end we just sat at the same computer to finish of small things together.
