I have been so busy doing the with other work these posts have fallen off. This semester I have been way more busy than I intended. I just finished the 3D reconstruction deliverable (only a week late). It was actually really cool to see how well the photogrammetry works. We haven't done a lot of work on the project. But it is definitely coming along nicely. We have some VR interaction. The avatar moves with the headset and is destroyed if it loses all 3 lives. I think it would be cool to add some 3D art to the game just to make it look a bit better. I think we just need to keep working on it and be aware of when it is due so we can make a plan to finish it. 
I need to start researching for my student lecture soon. Holography is a cool topic and I actually do think it will be fun to research. It feels like what I make could be a cool YouTube video. I haven't been able to find anything comprehensive about holography on YouTube yet so I think there is a niche there that isn't filled. I'm not saying I will make a yt video, I just think a random niche video about holography is something I would find on YouTube. And I guess I can get inspiration from those types of videos about how I can make my presentation interesting. I know YouTube video is a lot different from a lecture, but I think there is some overlap.
