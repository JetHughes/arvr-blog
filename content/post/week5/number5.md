Week 5. This semester is going quite fast. This week in the labs we did some more 360 video stuff. Andrew and I recorded some of our own videos in the basement carpark. We did a few from a high angle and some from a very low angle. Viewing the low angle video makes the environment around you seem huge. It's quite strange. I expected the video from the high angle to have a similar and opposite effect but it actually didn't. It just make me feel a bit taller than usual. We realised this is because from the low angle you are a small fraction of your usual height, but from the high angle you are only a little bit taller. It would be interesting to know if a recording from a drone up super high would make you feel like a huge person, or just as if you are flying in a drone.

Andrew and I have make a group for the project. I think we are both happy to work on the temple run idea. In the lab on Friday we started on a very simple prototype. You are placed on a long bridge and blocks come flying at you which you need to dodge. We tried it with the Oculus and It was actually pretty cool. We didn't figure out how to make a Rigidbody move with the camera yet though. I'm not sure which simply parenting it didn't work. 

We found an issue with the game though. How do you make the person feel like they are moving if they are standing still? We thought we could place the character on a hoverboard so they don't need to move their legs. Then, maybe the person could be standing of some kind of balance board which they tilted to move themselves side to side. It seemed rather dangerous though - unless we had something the player could hold while they play the game. 

I would like to work on the simulation game in my own time though. I think it could be very cool. I like the birds-eye perspective view idea. You could even switch views and sort of "descend" into ground perspective to get a closer look at things. It would be super interesting also to procedurally generate stuff like the environments, animals, and plants. These could all evolve and change their appearance procedurally based on their genes. I wonder if it would make sense to make it into a game with a winning condition, or if it could just be sandbox type thing. Maybe the player tries to keep their ecosystem alive for as long as possible. Maybe there is a fast-forward/time travel feature when you can accelerate through time and see what happens. 

This reminds me of something somewhat unrelated but I thought I might just put it here anyway. Dinosaurs walked the earth for at least a hundred million years.  The earliest Humans were alive only a few million years ago. Most of the time (at least for me) I think of the far future as being thousands of years away. Like what will happen in 3000? Who knows. But does anyone think about what will happen in 22345?? Is that even worth thinking about? I didn't really realise until now how short 1000 years in the future is.
I need to figure out how to add images to this blog.

## Key Points
- Need to add images
- Started basic prototype of temple run game with Andrew
- How to make people feel like they are moving in VR when they aren't. Would this be safe?
- Time is long.
